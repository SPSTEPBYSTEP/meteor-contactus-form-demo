        <p>This is a Twitter bootstrap modal contact us form that stores the data in a mongodb collection and also emails both the site owner and the person who completes the form.  It also includes alerts and some jazzy fades.</p>
        <p>Obviously, this does not demonstate the awesome real-time publishing subscribing and real-time rendering magic and total awesomeness of <a href="http://www.meteor.com">Meteor</a>. This is meant more as a place to start learning about processing data into Meteor and as a way to learn more about form processing.</p>
        <p>I am a javascript noob. I started javascript programming when Meteor launched.  The first difficulty I encountered was figuring out how to get data into Meteor and the underlying mongodb. This may not be the most efficient or effective way of to accomplish form or data processing, but I found it useful and felt it worthwhile to share.  I am sure the code base could use quite a bit of improvement.  As well, it is packaged in a way that you can drop it into any project and just create a link to the <a data-toggle="modal" href="#contactUsDialog">Contact Us form</a>.</p>
