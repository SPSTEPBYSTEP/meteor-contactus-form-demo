        This is a Twitter bootstrap modal contact us form that stores the data in a mongodb collection and also emails both the site owner and the person who completes the form.  It also includes the current data lock down methods, some basic client side and server side data validation, some nifty alerts and some jazzy fades.

        This does not demonstrate the totally rad and awesome real-time publishing subscribing and real-time rendering wizardly magic and total gnarly awesomeness of <a href="http://www.meteor.com">Meteor</a>. This is meant more as a place to start learning about processing data into Meteor and as a way to learn more about form processing when building an app or website with Meteor.

        I am a javascript noob. I started javascript programming when Meteor launched. The first difficulty I encountered was figuring out how to get data into Meteor and the underlying mongodb. I kept approaching it from the traditional back end server side programming point of view. I really had to stretch my head and think inside out, upside down and every which way but loose!  Left turn Clyde!

        This may not be the most efficient or effective way to accomplish form or data processing, but I found it useful and felt it worthwhile to share. I am sure the code base could use quite a bit of improvement.  It is packaged in a way that you can drop it into any project, npm install nodemailer from your public directory, set the configuration settings in contactus.js and just create a link to the <a data-toggle="modal" href="#contactUsDialog">Contact Us form</a> and it should just work.
